This is your first week at the startup, UdaciSearch. You've been hired on as an Engineer, and you're really excited to make a big splash. UdaciSearch is interested in figuring out popular search terms on the internet in order to improve the SEO of their clients. Everyone wants to pop up at the top of a potential user's search!

You are given the source code for your company's legacy web crawler, which is _**single-threaded**_. You notice it's a bit slow, and you quickly realize a way to improve its performance and impress your new manager. 

You can upgrade the code to take advantage of multi-core architectures to increase crawler throughput. Furthermore, you will measure the performance of your crawler to prove that, given the same amount of time, the multi-threaded implementation can visit more web pages than the legacy implementation. It might just be your first week, but you're set to impress!
